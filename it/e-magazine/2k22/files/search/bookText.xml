                                         DR. Parth Shah , HOD






         “Kudos to the core team of “Campus Jam” and teachers of the department for taking
         such a nice initiative ahead. I am thankful for the team to help the department to

         reﬂect the activities carried out.The magazine has served as the perfect medium for
         students to showcase their creativity, technical skills and achievements.





         All these achievements of the department would not have been possible without the
         enthusiastic and dedicated work of our past and present teachers. The teachers are

         exceptionally dedicated and self-motivated. The Faculty members have membership
         ACM,  CSI  and  IEEE.  So  far  more  than  200  publications  have  been  done  by  the

         teachers  which  shows  the  hunger  for  the  research.  Grant  of  more  than  10  Lakh
         received from MHRD, NVIDIA, AICTE, DST and GUJCOST by teachers to develop
         the  projects  or  arrange  the  teachers  and  students  development  programs.  Many

         teachers  of  the  department  have  also  won  and  have  been  conferred  many
         prominent awards.

         Starting 2000, the department began the B Tech program. Being an integral part of
         an institution of the stature of the C S Patel Institute of Technology naturally helps

         the department and its programmes imbibe all the values and ethos that have made
         the institute an epitome of excellence. The department started the Post Graduate
         Diploma in Cyber Security to oﬀer the industry standard course for the professionals.

         To introduce self learning and provide exposure to eminent teachers of IIT and other
         reputed  institute  departments  has  established  NPTEL  local  chapter.


         The department has also established AWS and EC-Council academies to enhance

         the students' knowledge beyond the regular curriculum.


         The  students  of  our  department  are  enthusiastic  about  the  technical  &  creative
         aspects of our curriculum. They actively participate in all the activities organized by

         the  department  and  the  univeristy.Our  students  have  achieved  great  heights  in
         terms of recognised certiﬁcations as well as competitions.



         Of Course, the placement is tremendously increasing day by day due to the support
         from  various  industries.  Not  to  forget  our  students  even  have  high  ambitions  for
         studying even further for which they have scored remarkable marks in respective

         exams.


         We are supremely conﬁdent that in years to come the department with its rigorous
         and regularly updated syllabus, top notch research, innovative teaching techniques

         and active participation with industry will enforce the reputation of itself as well as
         that of CSPIT as an enviable seat of higher learning.”

             in a crowd by upscaling their soft skills and creative mindset.


             We organize and support programs and practices that focus on developing good
             soft  skills  essential  for  professional  growth  of  the  students.  With  the  rapid
             advancements in technology, the market has become highly competitive, making
             soft skills an integral part in the corporate world.

             Creative Writing, Debate, Aptitude/Guesstimates/Puzzles for the students. Also,
             Sport tournaments and dance events are organized to enhance the physical
             wellbeing and interest of the students.


             We encourage co-curricular activities while maintaining the integrity and interest
             of the organization. In the past, we have successfully carried out events such as
             Think Out Loud, Quarantine got talent and a few Codechef and blogging contests
             in our campus.


             Our  last  event  was  a  webinar  conducted  by  an  experienced  development
             executive which aimed to impart knowledge about communication and business
             skills. With the oﬄine mode back on track, we intend to take our ideas and reach
             to the next level.

         The four years I spent at CHARUSAT are till date the best four years of my life.

         Apart  from  the  fun  that  I  had  being  a  student  there,  university's  company
         relations  have  helped  me  a  lot  in  my  career.  In  my  ﬁnal  year,  I  secured  an

         internship  at  Thomson  Reuters  in  Ahmedabad  through  the  university's

         placement  drive.  Aftercompleting  my  internship,  I  moved  to  Canada  for  my

         masters, and worked for a year for the Government of Canada as a software

         developer.  I  am  now  back  at  Thomson  Reuters  in  Toronto  as  a  software
         engineer,  and  my  previous  internship  has  played  a  huge  role  inhelping  me

         get this job. I am extremely grateful to all my professors for providing me with

         the right skillset to excel globally.

         A department that feels like a second home. Starting frombeing helpful
         ,  all  the  teachers  have  given  priority  to  buildingour  personalities  as  a

         whole.  My  experience  with  the  ITdepartment  is  and  will  be  the  most

         cheerful  one,  from  academics  to  sports,  co-curricular  activities  and
         events thathelped us shape our tomorrow. I have not only been limited
         to  college  facilities,  but  the  industrial  visits  and  the  number  of

         internships oﬀered gave me a better understanding of the real picture
         of  the  industry.  Apart  from  the  academics  and  the  opportunities,  I

         would  love  to  highlight  the  strength  of  the  department  that  stands  up
         during  tech  and  non  tech  fests.  The  teachers,  students,  HoD  sir,  and

         everyone involvedwith us worked as a joint unit to make us feel home.
         College will always remain a home away from home. To all the freshers

         of  this  year,  you  are  going  to  have  the  best  roller  coaster  ride,  some
         experiences  might  shine  a  light  and  others  might  not,  but  there  is  one

         thing that you have you remember, you are strongerthan you think.

         Being a part of Charusat University was a brilliant experience. Aside from Charusat

         University, I'd like to point out that selecting the IT department was the ﬁnest option I

         made. Because the IT department's staﬀ is incredibly helpful and treats all students
         equally. They also provided us with good advice on even small issues. I'd also want to

         point out that faculties oﬀer assistance and guidance as part of the project or in the

                                      I am Pranav Bhuchhada (17IT011), I am a ﬁnal year B. Tech IT
                                      student from CSPIT, CHARUSAT. I am working in an esteemed
                                      organization, situated in Vadodara, called “One Advanced”as
                                      an associate software developer. And I can say that it is not
                                      easy for a fresh engineer to get a job in such an organization
                                      without any support. I think it was my department which made
                                      me so prepared for the whole interview process, like aptitude
                                      , technical interview and HR interview. I was provided with the
                                      best instructor for the process, surprisingly I also had mock
                                      technical  and  HR  interviews  with  the  industry  personnel.
                                      There would be many other things that I might have missed,
                                      but I can say CSPIT-IT placement cell has helped me in every
                                      aspect related to my career growth.

        The IT placement cell has helped me immensely in preparing
        for the interviews. The teachers have been very supportive in
         helping us revise and brush up previous concepts and there                                   - - - - - - - -
        were  also  separate  classes  for  aptitude  and  personality
        development  by  experts.  Overall,  it  was  a  great  learning
        experience.

             I ________ You


             I need to ﬁnd the answer of that blank.

             But idk if i ever will.
             What do i put there...that will justify the feelings i have for you?


             Shall i put "really care about"?

             Coz trust me i really do.


             Or shall I put "crazy about"?
             Coz nowadays all my friends are saying that "you are crazy after her"... And as a
             matter of fact i might be.



             Or shall I put "need"?
             Coz I need you when I am happy. I need you when i am feeling low. I need you in
             every stage of my life.



             Or shall I put "hate"?
             Coz i hate you and get so mad at you when you don't answer to my calls and never
             callback. Do you have any idea how badly i wanna talk to you? Infact i just want to
             hear your voice. I hate you for making me wait for eternity for your callback. (But
             just so you know, if you are going to call me back then i don't mind waiting for

             another eternity).


             Or shall i put "love"?
             Now, i don't have a reason for this. My mind can't come up with any reason to put

             "love" in that blank. But my heart do. He hasn't told me yet. But I trust him.


             Or shall I put "envy"?
             Coz you have something that i don't.
             You have someone in your life who really cares about you, crazy about you, needs

              you, hates you and more importantly loves you.

            A mother's love is something
            That no can explain,
            It is made of deep devotion.
            And of sacriﬁce and pain...
            It is endless and unselﬁsh
            And enduring comes what may
            For nothing can destroy it
            Or take that love away....
            It is patient and forgiving
            When all other are forsaking.
            And it never fails or fade
            Even though the heart is breaking...
            When the world around deplore
            And it glows with all the beauty of the
            rarest, brightest gems...
            It is far beyond deﬁning,
            It deﬁes all explanation,
            And it still remains a secret
            Like the mysteries of creation...
            A many Splendored miracles
            Man cannot understand,
             And another wondrous evidence
            Of God's tender guiding hand...

            Are we ready for Metaverse & Augmented Reality


         In 1992, when the internet was still new American novelist Neal Stephenson spoke
         about virtual reality in his book called ‘Snow Crash’. A virtual world where people

         would use digital avatars to live, work and play online. He called it ‘the Metaverse’
         A blend of ‘meta’ meaning beyond ‘verse’ derived from the word universe.


         Tech giants like Apple, Microsoft, Google & Facebook are racing to claim the

         metaverse, a virtual universe that will co-exist with the physical one. Facebook has
         even changed its name to ‘Meta’ to stay on top of the curve.



         Metaverse is a technology based on augmented reality that could change how we
         live and interact forever. Think of it as an internet that you are not just looking at but

         also living in. Your digital avatar will inhibit the metaverse and instead of watching or
         reading about a topic, you will be experiencing it, doing those actions yourself
         digitally along with others who want to be a part of your experience.



         It's not just the tech giants that are leaning towards Metaverse. Disney wants create

         its own metaverse. It would be an extension of Disney’s ﬁlms and streaming services.
         Even the government is leaning towards it. In 2021, the government of South Korea

         announced the creation of a national metaverse alliance.


         The Metaverse combines the core technologies critical to the digitisation of

         everything. IoT and 5G collect the data, Cloud computing to support the twin

         infrastructure, and AI and Automation to predict, simulate and automate the
         environments. A sixth technology, mixed reality, enables virtual interaction.




         The metaverse is not an App Store with a catalogue of titles, the metaverse must

         have the ability to take you places together with your friends and have real-life
         experiences or even more. No single company is going to achieve on its own

         without the concerted eﬀorts of others in the sector.



         Just like the internet today, the metaverse won’t be a single technology that gets

         switched on at once, but rather an ecosystem built over time by many diﬀerent
         companies using a variety of technologies.



                                                                    Akanksha Pandey, 19IT074

                          India at 3rd in startup ecosystem, has the

                                            golden era started.

             “We all have entrepreneur inside us, a platform is what we need to bring the

                                                entrepreneur out”

         After  independence,  India  had  to  build  from  scratch.  "There  was  such  a  candid
         attitude." India today is not the country of the past as seen in the West. Today, thanks
         to the initiative and resilience of the current government, there are 81 unicorns in
         India  with a total value of $274 billion. In addition, out of the 500 unicorns in the
         United  States,  90  of  the  founders    were  Indian.  It  will  not  be  wrong  to  say  that
         Indians  are  and  will  play  a  pivotal  role  in  the  global  landscape  of  StartUps.


         In contemporary times words like StartUp, Entrepreneurship, Seeding have become
         a popular topic of discussion among youths. StartUp India has been fundamental for

         this  positive  spur  of  change.  This  groundbreaking  initiative  has  enabled  young
         people  to  nurture    innovation  and  fulﬁll  their  dreams  of  starting  startups  and
         foundations.


         Many young people with diverse aspirations  need to get a quality education and be
         prepared  for  future  opportunities.  For  young  people,  the  dream  of  becoming  an
         entrepreneur  is  linked  to  a  desire  to  provide  quality  courses  as  well  as  universal

         excellence.    At  the  macro  level,  this  new  energy  surge  is  changing  the
         entrepreneurial  structure  of  a  nation  built  over  decades.    Indian  youngsters  are
         positively impatient. Can't wait to turn their dreams into ideas and ideas into reality.
         Gone are the days when parents forced their students to do routine research and
         limited their aspirations to boring standard tasks. Since the launch of Startup India in
         2015; It has become a leader in comprehensive revolutionary change, not only in
         terms of opportunity, but also in people's thinking.



         Government  of  India  does  exactly  this  because  Startup  India  Platform  educates
         young people to pursue their entrepreneurial dreams by oﬀering 79 courses. The
         GOI  also  recognizes  and  recognizes  these  startups  through  the  National  Startup
         Award. According to the oﬃcial report, India's startup ecosystem is the 3rd largest in
         the world with more than 61,000 established startups spanning 55 sectors and 635
         districts.  In  addition  to  this,  India  received  the  acronym  for  the  world's  fastest
         growing startup ecosystem with  82 unicorns. To celebrate and further encourage

         this growth, Prime Minister Modi has called startups  the “background” of New India
         and has designated January 16 as National Startup Day.  If this pace continues, it will
         not  be  long  before  India  emerges  as  an  economic  superpower  on  the    100th
         anniversary  of  independence  (Aazadi  ka  Amrit  Mahotsav)  with  the  active
         participation of the citizens of Atmanirbara.
