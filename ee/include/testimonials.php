                Electrical Engineering department is having faculties with great knowledge in different fields. Girls have equal opportunities as boys in the field of sports. I, being the captain of CHARUSAT Girls Volleyball team, got a huge platform to showcase my talent. Me and my team had won many competitions including Mahakhumbh at district level.  The facilities provided to girls in the CHARUSAT Girls Hostel are also good. We have facility of hot water, gas stove, refrigerator, television and also have some AC rooms. <br>

                  I find a large pool of opportunity which helped me a lot to enhance my resume as well as my hobby skills. Our university organizes technical event namely COGNIZANCE which is a very good medium for students to show their technical knowledge and learn many new things with fun. Besides this, we celebrate almost all major festivals such as Navratri, Holi, Uttrayan and many more in our campus.  <br><br><br><br>

                From my brief experience over here in M. Eng. (Western University at London, Ontario), I am very surprised and glad to inform that most of my course content in M. Eng. over here has been taught to us in our bachelor’s degree only at M & V Patel Department of Electrical Engineering, CSPIT, CHARUSAT, Changa. Although the depth of content here has increased but obviously the basics that have been taught there are immensely useful here.
				The teaching methods used there, and the talent pool of teachers is outstanding. <br>

CHARUSAT can be best explained as THE DEEPER THE ROOTS.. THE RICHER THE TREES.  We are privileged to be a part of the family that  provides the perfect blend of active learning,  quality education to excel in fields.  Also in the last few years, it is NAAC accreditation with Grade A with the best college in the state as well the country. All these have inculcated in my ward the holistic learning, competitive abilities and intellectual skills that helped her to get placed in POLYCAB India’s No. 1 Cables & Wires Company.
We wish Electrical Department to keep excelling in all realms.
