On March 2th, the Creativity and Innovation Club(CAIC), organised a
one-day workshop on 3D Modelling through Blender. The main motive
of the event was to enlighten students with the current trends in 3D
Modelling and get themselves acquainted with the Blender workshop.
During the workshop, attendees were taught how to use Blender for 3D
Modelling.

Divyesh Patel Sir (CSPIT â€“ CE Department) and Sagar Patel Sir(CSPIT-
CE Department)conducted the workshop. The emphasis was basically on

the user interface of the software and the advancements in the technology
and the applications of blender software in the industry.
The participants were excited for the Kahoot quiz and awards were given
to the winners. At the end of the day, CAIC received a positive response
from all the participants. Attendees were given the roadmap for 3D
Modelling; if they wish to pursue it as a career. Some of the core
committee members also displayed their work in Blender which they had
done as a part of a project.
