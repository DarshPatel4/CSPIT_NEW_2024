The dedicated faculty at CSPIT played a crucial role in honing my skills and creating an enriching learning atmosphere. Throughout my time there, I was presented with abundant opportunities that greatly enhanced my capabilities, ultimately propelling me to my current esteemed position. My success stands as a testament to the high-quality education and nurturing guidance I received at CSPIT, empowering me to make significant contributions in the society.

                From printing "Hello World" in Turbo C++ to competing and beating students of IITs and NIT's not once but thrice in hackathons, that's level of resources CHARUSAT provides to their students. Despite the fact that I was a complete beginner in the programming world, my professors at CHARUSAT saw potential in me and helped me advance to the point where, in my final year, I was receiving an award and a cheque for 2,00,000 INR from the deputy chief minister of Gujarat. The relationships and networks I formed at the university extended beyond the four years I spent studying undergrad, but they helped me get admitted on a full scholarship to the University of Alberta for my master's programme. I appreciate all the support, CHARUSAT.

                CHARUSATs' computer department (cspit-ce) provided me with the chance to interact with other people and pick up new skills. I've gotten a lot of help from the faculties and the placement office. I appreciate the Training & Placement cell for giving me the chance to develop my abilities and for giving me a platform on which to do so. I would like to thanks my wonderful university for all the support that helps me to grow in my professional career.

                Pursuing B.Tech from CHARUSAT was life changing for me, I found faculties very positive, motivated and highly skilled in their area. I met the best people during my undergraduate who not only helped me find my passion but also always motivated to achieve more. I would also like to call out the great initiatives by professors, like Microsoft, Oracle, AWS academy sessions, Expert Seminars, Extraordinary Presentations and Labs and Experimentation. Here faculties not only focus on engineering studies but also overall development who can help you find your passion, finding guide as well as helping you balance engineering with extracurricular activities like music, art, dance and sports etc. I would highly recommend CHARUSAT for those who are passionate about Machines and wants to learn/grow, explore different areas and achieve more.

                 As I recall my time spent at CSPIT, CHARUSAT, the most prevalent memories are those of the dedicated professors who truly devoted their time and talents to making sure that my fellow classmates and I were prepared for the challenges that lay ahead. The combination of small class sizes, broad interdisciplinary specialization among the faculty, and a curriculum designed to teach not only the theory of Computer Science, but also the practice, culminated in a valuable education greater than the sum of its parts. So well spent was my time at CSPIT, CHARUSAT, that I felt not only confident in my abilities upon first entering the workforce, but also better prepared than my peers who had graduated from larger, research-based institutions.

                 I would like to express my heartiest thanks to the department of computer engineering, CHARUSAT University. I got a lot of support and motivation from my teachers, and it made my 4 years. This is the place where I learnt a lot. 4 years are not enough to experience all the wonderful things that this place has to offer.
