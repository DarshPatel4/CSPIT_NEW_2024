              The college gave us the platform where we were able to showcase our technical abilities and also developed our personality. With all the moral support I gained from my faculties of CSPIT, I achieved an experience which I may not have had as a team leader. Iâ€™m very much proud to be an alumni of such a beautiful college and be a part of the CHARUSAT family.

                It gives me great pride to speak out to people that I am a student of mechanical department of CHARUSAT University. This is because in terms of knowledge and teaching the faculties of department  are far beyond excellence. Also the support they give to students in terms of motivation, ideas, extra classes, and assignments are all very helpful for the students to learn and master the concepts easily. Furthermore the extra curricular activities and events like the Vrund, Cognizance, Spoural, Quill magazine and many more help students show their talent and also pursue there passion with studies and therefore students do not feel bored and fatigued due to classes. The overall management and resource facilities in terms of E-learning centres, libraries and playground add to the beauty of the University and positive atmosphere for students in campus.
